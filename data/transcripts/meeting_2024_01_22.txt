PRODUCT ROADMAP REVIEW - Q1 2024
Date: January 22, 2024
Attendees: David Park (VP Product), Marcus Williams (CTO), Alex Chen (Lead Designer), Emily Rodriguez (Product Manager)

OBJECTIVE: Review Q1 product roadmap and prioritize features based on customer feedback

DISCUSSION:

David started by sharing feedback from our recent customer advisory board meeting. Enterprise customers are asking for three main things:
1. Better reporting and analytics
2. Easier onboarding for new team members  
3. Integration with Salesforce and HubSpot

Emily presented data from our user research. We surveyed 200 customers last month. The top feature request was "advanced filtering capabilities" with 68% of respondents marking it as "critical." Second was "mobile app" at 45%.

Marcus reviewed the engineering team's capacity. With our current team of 12 engineers and the 3 new hires starting in February, we can realistically ship 2-3 major features in Q1. He recommended we prioritize based on:
- Customer impact
- Revenue potential
- Technical feasibility

Alex showed mockups for the new analytics dashboard. The design includes customizable widgets, real-time data updates, and export capabilities. Customer feedback on the mockups has been overwhelmingly positive - 9 out of 10 customers said they would use this feature daily.

OPPORTUNITIES IDENTIFIED:

1. ENTERPRISE INTEGRATION: Building Salesforce and HubSpot integrations could unlock 20+ enterprise deals currently in our pipeline. These integrations are a dealbreaker for many F500 companies.

2. ANALYTICS UPSELL: The advanced analytics dashboard could be positioned as a premium add-on, generating an additional $50K-$100K in MRR.

3. MOBILE-FIRST CUSTOMERS: Launching the mobile app could help us penetrate new verticals like field services and retail, where employees are primarily mobile.

RISKS AND CONCERNS:

Marcus flagged a technical risk: our current database architecture may not scale well for real-time analytics. We might need to invest in infrastructure upgrades before shipping the analytics feature. This wasn't in the original plan and could delay the Q1 timeline by 2-3 weeks.

Emily raised a concern about product complexity. We're adding a lot of features quickly, and she's worried about making the product too complicated for new users. She suggested we invest in better onboarding tutorials and in-app guidance.

David noted a market risk: two competitors recently launched similar analytics features. We need to differentiate ourselves or we'll be playing catch-up. He proposed we focus on "AI-powered insights" as a unique selling point.

PRIORITIZATION DECISION:

After discussion, the team agreed on this Q1 priority order:
1. Advanced analytics dashboard (HIGH PRIORITY - customer demand + revenue potential)
2. Salesforce integration (HIGH PRIORITY - unlocking enterprise pipeline)
3. Mobile app beta for iOS (MEDIUM PRIORITY - new market opportunity)
4. HubSpot integration (DEFERRED to Q2 - lower priority than Salesforce)

ACTION ITEMS:

1. Alex to finalize analytics dashboard designs by January 29th and hand off to engineering

2. Marcus to investigate database scaling options and provide cost estimate by February 2nd  

3. Emily to create onboarding tutorial scripts for new features by February 5th

4. David to draft sales collateral highlighting AI-powered insights differentiation by February 10th

5. Marcus to assign engineering pods to each Q1 feature and create detailed sprint plans

NEXT STEPS:
- Weekly product sync every Monday at 10am
- First sprint starts February 1st
- Mid-quarter review scheduled for February 28th

Overall sentiment: Cautiously optimistic. Exciting opportunities ahead, but aware of technical and competitive risks that need to be managed carefully.
