QUARTERLY PLANNING MEETING - Q1 2024
Date: January 15, 2024
Attendees: Sarah Chen (CEO), Marcus Williams (CTO), Jennifer Liu (CFO), David Park (VP Product)

AGENDA:
1. Q4 2023 Performance Review
2. Q1 2024 Roadmap
3. Budget Allocation
4. Hiring Plans
5. Key Risks & Opportunities

MEETING NOTES:

Sarah opened the meeting by reviewing Q4 performance. Revenue came in at $2.3M, which was 8% above target. Customer acquisition cost decreased by 15%, and we now have 450 enterprise customers.

Marcus presented the engineering roadmap for Q1. The team plans to ship three major features:
- Advanced analytics dashboard (targeting Fortune 500 companies)
- API v3 with improved rate limits
- Mobile app beta for iOS and Android

However, Marcus raised a serious concern about the engineering team's capacity. We currently have 12 engineers, but to hit our Q1 targets, we need at least 15. He suggested we prioritize hiring 2-3 senior engineers immediately, with a target start date of February 1st.

Jennifer provided the financial update. We have $8M in the bank, which gives us 18 months of runway at current burn rate. She proposed allocating $500K for Q1 marketing spend, focused on enterprise outreach. She also flagged that our customer churn rate has increased slightly to 4%, which we need to monitor closely.

David discussed product strategy. He identified a major opportunity: expanding into the healthcare vertical. Three healthcare companies have requested HIPAA compliance features. If we can ship this by March, we could potentially land 10-15 new healthcare customers worth $150K in ARR.

However, David also noted a competitive risk. Our main competitor, TechFlow Inc., just raised a $50M Series B and is aggressively hiring. They're targeting the same enterprise segment. We need to move fast to maintain our competitive advantage.

ACTION ITEMS:

1. HIRING: Marcus to post job descriptions for 2 senior backend engineers and 1 frontend engineer by January 20th. Target start date: February 1st.

2. HIPAA COMPLIANCE: David to create a detailed spec for HIPAA features by January 25th. Marcus to review feasibility and provide timeline estimate.

3. CUSTOMER RETENTION: Jennifer to analyze churn data and present findings at next week's leadership meeting. Investigate why customers are leaving and propose retention strategies.

4. MARKETING BUDGET: Jennifer to finalize Q1 marketing budget allocation by January 22nd. Focus on enterprise outreach and case study development.

5. COMPETITOR ANALYSIS: David to prepare a competitive analysis of TechFlow Inc. by January 30th. Identify their strengths, weaknesses, and our differentiation points.

DECISIONS MADE:
- Approved $500K marketing budget for Q1
- Prioritized HIPAA compliance feature for Q1 release
- Greenlighted hiring of 3 engineers

Next meeting: January 22, 2024

Overall sentiment: Positive momentum, but awareness of competitive pressure and resource constraints.
