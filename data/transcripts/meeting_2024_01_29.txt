RISK REVIEW & MITIGATION MEETING
Date: January 29, 2024
Attendees: Sarah Chen (CEO), Marcus Williams (CTO), Jennifer Liu (CFO), David Park (VP Product), Rachel Thompson (VP People)

PURPOSE: Review open risks and develop mitigation strategies

AGENDA:
1. Engineering Capacity Constraints (RECURRING RISK)
2. Competitive Pressure from TechFlow Inc. (RECURRING RISK)
3. Customer Churn Rate Increase
4. Cash Runway Management
5. Key Hire Dependencies

RISK #1: ENGINEERING CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS

Marcus: "This is the third meeting where we've discussed engineering capacity. We're still short-staffed. We posted the job descriptions two weeks ago and have only received 8 applications, none of which are senior-level candidates."

Rachel provided an update on hiring: The market for senior engineers is extremely competitive right now. Average time-to-hire for senior roles is 90 days. She recommended we:
- Increase salary bands by 15% to be more competitive
- Offer signing bonuses of $20K for senior hires
- Consider remote candidates to expand the talent pool

Sarah approved the budget increase, but emphasized this needs to be resolved by mid-February or we'll have to descope the Q1 roadmap.

RISK #2: COMPETITIVE PRESSURE FROM TECHFLOW INC.

David: "TechFlow just announced they're cutting prices by 30% to gain market share. This is going to impact our enterprise pipeline."

Jennifer analyzed the financial impact. If we lose 5-10 enterprise deals due to pricing, that's $200K-$400K in ARR at risk. She doesn't recommend we match their pricing - our margins would become unsustainable.

David proposed a differentiation strategy: emphasize our superior customer support (4.8/5 rating vs their 3.2/5) and our advanced analytics capabilities. He also suggested we accelerate the HIPAA compliance feature since TechFlow doesn't support it yet.

RISK #3: CUSTOMER CHURN INCREASE

Jennifer presented the churn analysis. Churn increased from 2.5% to 4% over the past quarter. Exit interviews revealed three main reasons:
1. Customers find the product too complex
2. Lack of integration with tools they already use
3. Inadequate customer support for smaller accounts

Emily from Product team joined to discuss solutions:
- Simplify the onboarding flow (reduce from 8 steps to 4 steps)
- Build Salesforce and HubSpot integrations (already on roadmap)
- Hire 2 additional customer success managers for SMB accounts

RISK #4: CASH RUNWAY

Jennifer: "With the increased hiring budget and marketing spend, our monthly burn rate will increase from $450K to $550K. This reduces our runway from 18 months to 14.5 months."

She recommended we start planning for a Series A fundraise in Q3 2024. We should target $10-15M at a reasonable valuation.

Sarah agreed this is prudent but wants to delay fundraising until we've proven strong Q1-Q2 growth metrics.

RISK #5: KEY HIRE DEPENDENCIES

Rachel flagged that several Q1 initiatives depend on hiring the right people:
- Analytics dashboard depends on hiring a senior data engineer
- Mobile app depends on hiring an iOS developer
- HIPAA compliance depends on hiring a security engineer

If we can't fill these roles by mid-February, we need backup plans. Marcus suggested using contractors temporarily, though he acknowledged this isn't ideal for complex, long-term projects.

MITIGATION ACTIONS:

1. HIRING ACCELERATION: Rachel to engage recruiting agency for senior engineering roles. Budget approved: $50K for agency fees. Target: 3 offers extended by February 15th.

2. COMPETITIVE STRATEGY: David to create competitor battle card highlighting our differentiators. Sales team to be trained on how to handle pricing objections.

3. CHURN REDUCTION: Emily to ship simplified onboarding by February 20th. Rachel to post customer success manager roles by February 1st.

4. FUNDRAISING PREP: Jennifer to start building Series A investor deck. Target: draft ready by March 1st for Sarah's review.

5. CONTRACTOR BACKUP PLAN: Marcus to identify 2-3 trusted contractor firms we can engage if permanent hires fall through.

DECISIONS:
- Approved 15% increase in engineering salary bands
- Approved $50K recruiting agency budget
- Committed to starting Series A prep work in Q1

Next risk review meeting: February 12, 2024

Overall sentiment: Concerned but proactive. Multiple risks require immediate attention, but team has clear mitigation plans in place.
